The 2 Pointers Approach is a technique used in programming to solve problems efficiently by using two pointers that move through a data structure simultaneously. This approach is commonly used in array and linked list problems to optimize time complexity. The two pointers can move at different speeds or in different directions based on the specific problem requirements. By strategically positioning and moving these pointers, algorithms can be designed to solve various tasks like searching, sorting, and manipulating data structures effectively. The 2 Pointers Approach is particularly useful for problems that involve searching for a pair of elements, finding subarrays with specific properties, or detecting patterns within a sequence of elements. This technique leverages the concept of multiple pointers to enhance the efficiency of algorithms and is widely employed in competitive programming and real-world applications.
