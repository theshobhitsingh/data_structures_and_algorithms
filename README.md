# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my first GitHub repository! This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It aims to document and share my understanding and implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## About the Repository

This repository is a personal project where I am systematically learning and implementing different data structures and algorithms. It serves as a collection of my notes, code implementations, and problem-solving techniques related to DSA. 

### Repository Content

- **Data Structures**: Implementations and explanations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
- **Algorithms**: Solutions and explanations for different algorithms including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph algorithms.
- **Practice Problems**: A collection of problems and challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal to practice and enhance problem-solving skills.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this repository are:

1. **Learning and Understanding**: To deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms through practical implementation and problem-solving.
2. **Sharing Knowledge**: To share the knowledge I gain with others who are learning DSA, providing clear explanations and well-documented code.
3. **Building a Portfolio**: To create a portfolio of my work in DSA that can be showcased to potential employers or collaborators.
